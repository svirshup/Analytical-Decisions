When the click through rate was increased, the optimal revenue was also increased because clicks are what you get paid for. Within each range, the higher of the two ranges resulted in a larger optimal revenue. The interesting thing was that none of the impression allocations changed once they were calculated the first time."

I tried many different ways of doing it, but there must have been something wrong in my notes and I wasn't able to get it working. However, I intuitively understand what should be happening here. The major difference is that instead of giving plant A 75kg of raw and plant B 45kg, it is allowing the model to make that allocation decision instead. This will intuitively improve the overall profit for the company. The only case it wouldn't improve it would be if 75-45 were already the optimal split, in which case it would stay the same. In general, adding additional constraints like the inital 75-45 split will only limit the maximium/minimum of the model."

For reasons like this, my recommendation to the CEO would be that plant B has more capacity and that their marginal profit is currently larger.

However, if you increase the price past a certain point, the profitibility will become zero because nobody will be willing to pay that much for an inn. This might be due to a limited range of prices for which this model was created with. The intuitive thing for this independent variable would be to have another transformed price variable with a negative coefficient, that would gradually turn the overall price effect negative.\n",

The size also makes sense, as more college students in the area would likely only slightly increase profitiblity during certain times of year (graduation, move-in day, etc.). The expectation here is that this variable would be strongly correlated with a seasonality dummy for those times of year.\n",

    "* Square root of the median income in the area\n",
    "    * For a unit increase in square root of median income, profitibility will decrease by 3.09 units, holding all else equal.\n",
    "    * This variable makes sense under the assumption that this is a relatively low-value hotel chain. If the LQM Inns chain is low-value, then people in/visiting more wealthy areas would likely rather choose a nicer place to stay. This might also be correlated with the variable for the price of the inn, which would likely increase in areas that are wealthy to begin with."

    "This is not the best approach to maximize total profitibility. As we'll see in the next question, this single hotel is not the best when you have only 10 million to spend, since some hotels are much cheaper than this one, and their combined profitability will be higher. On the other hand, if we were trying to optimize the average profitibility of all the hotels we owned, then this would be the optimial solution. There is no way to get a higher average than owning 1 hotel with the strongest individual profitibility. Any additional hotel purchased would lower the average. Increasing budget from 10 to 20 million would change the hotels purchased, but would not change the logic here. The method outlined in this question would be best for obtaining the highest average, but not the total highest profitibility."

If they are confident in their regression model, then I would recommend to them to consult their other business units in order to find the budget that they are comfortable spending on new hotels. This optimization problem will allow them to maximize profitibility while staying within a pre-defined budget range. However, their budget is not something that this optimization can determine for them, so that is why they need to consult other parts of their business first.\n",

When looking at the results, some of the values were not intuitive such as state population having a negative impact on the profitibility of the hotel. In this case, it is likely an issue with all the hotels being located in the same state, but the result does not make intuitive sense. I would recommend that the model be re-evaluated again before this optimization model is implemented, because the regression is the foundation of the optimization; it will spit out an answer, but that answer is only as accurate as the regression.\n"
